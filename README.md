# 💳 OOP Payment System (Python)

This project simulates a basic payment system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.  
It allows users to select a payment method (UPI or Credit Card) and processes the transaction using polymorphism.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Object-Oriented Design
- Abstract base class for Payments
- UPI and Credit Card as subclasses
- Encapsulation for secure payment details
- Polymorphic `pay()` method
- Console-based interaction
- Easy to extend (add NetBanking, Wallets, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Built-in `abc` module for abstraction
- CLI-based user input/output

---

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `.py` file
2. Open it in PyCharm, VS Code, or any IDE
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python OOPs-Concepts.py
4. Follow the prompts:
 Choose payment method
 Enter required details
 See the result!

📚 OOP Concepts Practiced
✅ Abstraction

✅ Inheritance

✅ Encapsulation

✅ Polymorphism

📈 Future Improvements
Add support for more payment types (NetBanking, Wallets)

Validate inputs (card number format, UPI ID)

Save transaction logs in a file

Build a GUI with Tkinter or Flask (for fun!)
